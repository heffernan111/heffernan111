        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer, field scientist, and postgraduate astrophysicist with a passion for real-time systems,
          off-grid autonomy, and expedition-based science. I’ve spent the last 12 years building distributed platforms
          across industry and academia; from Laravel-based control interfaces for robotic telescopes to Rust-based
          telemetry dashboards decoding satellite signals in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional path bridges observatory software, mission control systems, and DevOps engineering. But I’m just
          as comfortable in a kayak or remote field station as I am behind a terminal. My recent analogue astronaut
          expeditions have strengthened my belief that the future of science and exploration lies at the intersection of
          extreme environments, autonomy, and human adaptability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work with embedded Python in scientific systems — building lightweight automation pipelines, data 
          reduction tools, and interactive telemetry interfaces in harsh environments. This includes scripting onboard 
          telescope controls and remote sensing systems under hardware and bandwidth constraints.

        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
          I’m aiming toward a PhD in either solar physics, expeditionary sensing, or large-scale cosmological structure;
          ideally projects that combine data, software, and field deployment. Long-term, I hope to contribute to analogue
          mission training, Earth-space systems engineering, and one day, astronaut selection itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in the Hubble tension; the discrepancy between local and early-universe expansion
          rate measurements. My recent MSc work explores alternative redshift-distance relations and the possibility of
          wavelength-dependent propagation effects as a solution, bridging theory with observational astrophysics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical focus is on building resilient, observable systems for science in motion; be it an ocean-borne
          environmental platform, a satellite-ground telemetry bridge, or a remote-control stack for an isolated telescope.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're working in expedition science, wind dynamics, cosmology, or astronomical instrumentation, I’d love
          to connect.
